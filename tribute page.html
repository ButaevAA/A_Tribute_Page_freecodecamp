        The wild life of billionaire Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who eats one meal a day, dates models, and just said he's pouring $1 billion of his own wealth into a coronavirus relief fund

        As the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey had to testify on Capitol Hill in September before the Senate Intelligence Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee for hearings on foreign influence over social media platforms. Twitter stock fell 6% on the day he testified. The stock is up 12% this year after the company beat on revenue and profit in Q3—but also revealed a drop of 9 million monthly active users for the quarter.

        As CEO of Square, Jack Dorsey has had a very different year, with far fewer headaches. Square shares are up 70% in 2018. Square managed to release three new hardware devices in the past 13 months. Square’s Cash App surpassed PayPal-owned Venmo in cumulative downloads in July. All of this led us to name Square our Company of the Year. <br>
